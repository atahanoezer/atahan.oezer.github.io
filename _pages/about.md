I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Machine Learning at the University of Tuebingen. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree with high honors from Istanbul Technical University (ITU). As an M.Sc. student, I'm also part of the ITU Vision Lab research team, where I focus on Federated Learning, Large-Scale Anomaly Detection, Computer Vision, and Stochastic Optimization Methods. During my undergraduate studies, I co-founded the ITU AI Student Club and  participated in the ITU Robotics Team, as well as being a dedicated member of ITU Vision Lab and ITU AI Center.
